  My [BitBurner](https://bitburner-official.github.io/) scripts. You can use them I guess, they're not very good.<br>
  I kinda want to just make a Manager script for all of the main mechanics later tbh. <br>
  The reason they're not very good is; <br><br>

        <summary>!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!</summary> 
      <br>1. The order I've done BitNodes in (I did UnderWorld like 2 times, then BladeBurner, Source Genesis, maxxed out UnderWorld, maxxed out Source Genesis, Singularity, Recursion, Artificial Inteligence, and I'm currently doing HashNet, and planning to do BladeBurner 2079 after this.) <br><br>
      2. I didn't plan ahead with it at all (Currently, the only thing I've done in preparation for more content is add a placeholder in my Custom Overview script, and add all of the Corpo Upgrades to my hashnet quicksell script.) 
    </details>
  <br>3. I'm not very good at coding tbh :/
  <br><br> Lots of these scripts require APIs gotten from certain Source-Files, so check if you have them before trying to run them, and if you don't, don't get angry at me.
